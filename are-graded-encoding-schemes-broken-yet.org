A quick overview of attacks on Graded Encoding Schemes.

* GGH13

The first candidate graded encoding scheme based on an NTRU-like problem in ideal lattices cite:EC:GarGenHal13.

** Follow-Up Constructions

Attacks on GGH13 also apply to these follow-up constructions, which reduce parameter sizes.

- cite:EC:LanSteSte14
- cite:AC:ACLL15

** BROKEN Key Exchange

Polynomial-time attack in cite:EPRINT:HuJia15

** BROKEN Indistinguishability Obfuscation

- cite:FOCS:GGHRSW13 is broken in polynomial-time in cite:EPRINT:MilSahZha16.
- cite:EC:BGKPS14 is broken in polynomial-time in cite:EPRINT:MilSahZha16.
- cite:EPRINT:AGIS14 is broken in polynomial-time in cite:EPRINT:MilSahZha16.
- cite:EPRINT:BMSZ15 is broken in polynomial-time in cite:EPRINT:MilSahZha16.

** Other

- Subexponential classical without encodings of zero or using the zero-testing parameter for large levels of multilinearity $Îº$ in cite:EPRINT:CheJeoLee16 and cite:EPRINT:AlbBaiDuc16. The latter also points out a quantum polynomial-time attack under the same conditions.

* CLT13

The second candidate graded encoding scheme based on a problem related to the approximate GCD assumption cite:C:CorLepTib13.

** BROKEN Follow-Up Construction

cite:C:CorLepTib15 was put forward in response to the attack in cite:EC:CHLRS15, but was broken in polynomial-time for all applications in cite:EPRINT:MinFou15 and cite:EPRINT:CheLeeRyu15.

** BROKEN Key Exchange

Polynomial-time attack in cite:EC:CHLRS15.

** TODO Indistinguishability Obfuscation

* GGH15

** BROKEN Key Exchange

Polynomial-time attack in cite:EPRINT:Coron15.

** TODO Indistinguishability Obfuscation
